        <h3>A functional Calculator</h3>
        <p>
          This Basic Calculator project showcases my skills in front-end
          development by implementing a simple yet functional web-based
          calculator. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application
          allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition,
          subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user-friendly interface
          features a responsive design that works seamlessly across various
          devices, ensuring an optimal user experience. By utilizing JavaScript
          for the application logic, I demonstrated my ability to manage user
          input, perform calculations, and update the display dynamically. This
          project not only highlights my coding skills but also my commitment to
          creating intuitive and accessible web applications.
